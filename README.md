# QuickEd

Fast pairwise alignment using bit-parallel edit-distance algorithms

## Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

```bash
cmake ..
make
```

## Testing

To execute all tests, run:

```bash
cd build
make test # (or ctest)
```

## Debugging

For debugging, build using:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
make
```

### Generate code coverage data

```bash
cd build
ctest -T coverage
```

### Valgrind

Make sure that Valgrind is installed on your system.
Then run:

```bash
cd build
ctest -T memcheck
```

**Note:** Valgrind runs will fail for any test that uses SSE4.1 intrinsics (i.e. any test that uses either WINDOWED 2x1 or QUICKED, without force_scalar).
This is expected behaviour.

### AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer

To enable ASAN and UBSAN, build using:

```bash
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DASAN=ON ..
make
```

**Note:** ASAN and UBSAN runs will fail for any test that uses SSE4.1 intrinsics (i.e. any test that uses either WINDOWED 2x1 or QUICKED, without force_scalar) or the Python binding.
This is expected behaviour.
